                All weather data comes directly from the Aviation Digital Data Service, which apps 
                like ForeFlight use to get up to date weather data for airports. It's important
                to note that wind in METARs are displayed relative to true north, unlike in ATIS
                and AWOS readings over the radio, which are read in magnetic north. The wind direction
                printed on the TOLD card are in true north, however magnetic variation is considered
                when calculating headwind and crosswind components. Here is the simplified code that
                calculates crosswind and headwind components:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">true_wind_direction = int(wind_direction) + magnetic_variation
wind_difference = abs(true_wind_direction - int(runway) * 10)
wind_difference = min(wind_difference, 360 - wind_difference)

crosswind_component = abs(wind_speed * math.sin(wind_difference))
headwind_component = abs(wind_speed * math.cos(wind_difference))</code></pre><br>
            <p>
                Pressure altitude and density altitude are calculated with this code:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">pressure_altitude = field_elevation + ((29.92 âˆ’ altimeter) * 1000)
density_altitude = pressure_altitude + (120 * (temperature - 15))</code></pre><br>
            <p>
                Calculations for takeoff and landing distances as well climb rate all follow the rules published
                in the pilot's operating handbook for the Cessna 172R, taking into account headwinds, temperature, 
                density altitude, etc. Maneuvering speed (Va) is also calculated based on gross weight via this 
                formula:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">maneuvering_speed = 99 * math.sqrt(gross_takeoff_weight / 2450)</code></pre><br>
            <p>
                All weight and balance calculations are done exactly how we are taught in private pilot ground school
                using numbers published by the school. Make sure to double check that the weights for the airplanes are
                correct, because it might take a few weeks before I update the data to reflect any changes. If any
                numbers are different, I highly recommend selecting "Custom" in the aircraft dropdown. From there you 
                can enter the correct values so you can ensure that the weight and balance calculation is accurate.
                Also, I would greatly appreciate it if you reported the inaccuracy <a href="/message">here</a>. Thank you for
                using the site. Make sure to tell all your friends about it.
